# 2024 Week 1

## Week 1 recap
Week 1 is in the bag! Every year, it feels like the gameplay gets sharper right from the start, and this year is no exception. I was thrilled to see so many teams showcasing reliable cycling and nailing multi-piece autos from the get-go.

From what I've seen at the events, this game is going to be tough on robots. To go far, you're going to need a robot that's built like a tank. There's way less protected carpet than last year, with faster cycle times and more treacherous obstacles. There are plenty more chances for teams to find their robot on the end of a hard hit.

Anyway, on to the rankings!
